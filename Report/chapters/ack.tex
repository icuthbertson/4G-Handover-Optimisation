I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Robert C. Atkinson for his help and guidance throughout my progress in this project. I would also like to thank him for his donation of the Discrete Event Simulation framework used in the project.

I would also like to thank my friends and family for their support and encouragement over the course of the project.

Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend for her love and support over the last year.
