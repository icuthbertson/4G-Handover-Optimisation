\section{Project Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Research and understand the parameters used in 4G handovers.
	\item Create a basic simulation of a 4G network with mobiles moving around a group of base stations.
	\item Implement a machine learning algorithm to fine tune the handover parameters to improve the performance of the network.
	\item Evaluate the success of the machine learning approach in 4G handovers and compare this to using static parameters
\end{itemize}
\section{Project Outcomes}
During the time spent on the project all of the objectives have been met. The parameters that are used in the handover process, the \ac{TTT} and \ac{hys},
